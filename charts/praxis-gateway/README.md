# Praxis Gateway Helm Chart

Deploys the [Praxis](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/praxis) proxy as a
Kubernetes Deployment and Service. Give it a Praxis configuration in the
values, point it at a ConfigMap you manage, or start from the built-in
configuration. It needs no operator, CRDs, or controllers, so it works on its
own as a gateway, a reverse proxy, or a place to try Praxis out.

The chart also carries optional settings for specific setups, such as an edge
gateway or a gateway in an AI Grid Network (AGN). See
[Optional uses](#optional-uses).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.26
- Helm >= 3.12

## Quick start

Install from a local checkout:

```bash
helm install praxis-gateway charts/praxis-gateway \
  --namespace praxis --create-namespace
```

The built-in configuration answers `GET /` with a small JSON status and
everything else with 404. Send a request through the gateway:

```bash
kubectl -n praxis rollout status deployment/praxis-gateway
kubectl -n praxis port-forward service/praxis-gateway 8080:8080 &
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/
# {"status": "ok", "server": "praxis"}
```

`helm test praxis-gateway -n praxis` runs the chart's connectivity check.

## Configuring Praxis

The chart mounts one Praxis configuration at `/etc/praxis/praxis.yaml`.
`praxisConfig.source` is required by the schema and defaults to `byo`. Set it to
`operator` or `render` to select those sources. Grid routing values do not switch
the source automatically; use `render` explicitly.

The explicit modes are:

1. `byo` is a configuration you provide. Set
   `praxisConfig.byo.configMapName` to a ConfigMap you create and manage, or
   leave it empty to serve `praxisConfig.byo.inline`, which the chart stores
   in its own ConfigMap.
2. `operator` mounts the ConfigMap the Grid operator writes for this gateway
   (GridNetwork `gatewayRefs[].consumerConfig.enabled: true`).
   `praxisConfig.operator.configMapName` defaults to `praxis-consumer-config`,
   the operator's default. Set it when the GridNetwork sets another
   `consumerConfig.configMapName`. The chart always mounts the `praxis.yaml`
   key, and the pod starts once the ConfigMap exists. The operator's
   `praxis.yaml` has no caller authentication and no listener TLS, so a
   LoadBalancer or NodePort Service needs
   `praxisConfig.operator.allowUnauthenticatedExposure`,
   and `listenerTls` and `route` fail the install. Keep the Service ClusterIP behind
   an authenticating front that terminates TLS.
3. `render` forces the chart to render an AGN routing configuration from `praxisConfig.render`
   (see [AI Grid Network](#ai-grid-network-agn)).

### TLS to upstreams

`gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` mounts the Secret containing `tls.crt` and `tls.key`;
`gridIdentity.caSecretName` mounts the Secret containing `ca.crt`. Setting
`tlsSecretName` requires `caSecretName`. Use the same name for both when one Secret
holds all three files.
These values do not add TLS settings to `praxis.yaml`.

- **BYO:** Your `praxis.yaml` controls transport. For mTLS, set
  `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` and `gridIdentity.caSecretName`, and point cluster TLS paths
  to `gridIdentity.mountPath`.
- **Operator:** `clusterEndpoints[].transport.mode: mutual_tls` makes the operator
  write those file paths into `praxis.yaml`. Set `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` to the
  site identity Secret and `gridIdentity.caSecretName` to the Grid CA Secret.
  `gridIdentity.mountPath` must equal
  `consumerConfig.tlsCertMountPath`
  (default: `/etc/praxis/tls`).
- **Render:** Set `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` and
  `gridIdentity.caSecretName` to use mTLS. A remote-site backend without
  `transport.mode` uses `mutual_tls` when the identity Secret is set. Without
  that identity, omitting `transport.mode` fails the install. Set the identity
  for mTLS or select `plaintext` explicitly when cleartext is intended.
  A provider's local backend defaults to plaintext.
  `tls` transport verifies a server certificate without a client certificate;
  `plaintext` uses no TLS.

Settings of another source fail the install instead of being ignored. For
example, `praxisConfig.render.backends` with `source: byo` asks you to set
`source: render`.

See the [Praxis configuration reference][praxis-config] and the
[example configurations][praxis-examples] for what a configuration can do.

### Proxy to a Service

This configuration forwards every request to a Service in another namespace
and adds a response header:

```yaml
# praxis.yaml
listeners:
  - name: default
    address: "0.0.0.0:8080"
    filter_chains: [main]
filter_chains:
  - name: main
    filters:
      - filter: router
        routes:
          - path_prefix: "/"
            cluster: backend
      - filter: headers
        response_set:
          - name: X-Served-By
            value: praxis
      - filter: load_balancer
        clusters:
          - name: backend
            endpoints: ["my-app.my-namespace.svc:8080"]
insecure_options:
  # Service names resolve to private cluster addresses. See the note below.
  allow_private_upstreams: true
```

```bash
helm upgrade --install praxis-gateway charts/praxis-gateway \
  --namespace praxis --create-namespace \
  --set-file praxisConfig.byo.inline=praxis.yaml
```

A few things to keep in mind:

- Bind the listener to `0.0.0.0` on `port.containerPort` (8080 by default) so
  the Service and probes can reach it. Keep `admin` on loopback and reach it
  with `kubectl port-forward`.
- Praxis refuses upstream hostnames that resolve to private addresses, as a
  guard against server-side request forgery. Every in-cluster Service name
  resolves to one, so proxying to a Service by name needs
  `insecure_options.allow_private_upstreams: true`. A literal ClusterIP
  endpoint such as `10.96.12.34:8080` passes without it, but changes if the
  Service is recreated.
- Praxis also refuses endpoint names ending in `.local` at startup, which
  rules out the full `my-app.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local` form. Write
  Service names as `my-app.my-namespace.svc`; the pod's DNS search path
  completes them.
- Changing `praxisConfig.byo.inline` or the `praxisConfig.render` values the chart
  renders and running `helm upgrade` rolls the pods onto the new configuration
  without refusing requests (see `shutdownDelaySeconds`).

### Bring your own ConfigMap

```bash
kubectl -n praxis create configmap praxis-config --from-file=praxis.yaml
helm upgrade --install praxis-gateway charts/praxis-gateway \
  --namespace praxis --set praxisConfig.byo.configMapName=praxis-config
```

With `praxisConfig.byo.configMapName` set, a live Helm install or upgrade
looks up that ConfigMap in the release namespace. If it is missing, the chart
looks up the `kube-system` Namespace to detect a live cluster and then fails
before creating the Deployment. Offline `helm template` skips this check.
Any named ConfigMap must already exist, including one created by the operator.

The Helm client's credentials need `get` access to the named ConfigMap. When
it is missing, they also need `get` access to Namespace `kube-system`. A denied
lookup fails with the API permission error rather than the chart's missing
ConfigMap message. This check runs during rendering; it does not monitor the
ConfigMap after installation.

Set `praxisConfig.byo.key` when the configuration lives under another key. The chart
does not manage this ConfigMap, so editing it does not restart the pods. The
default Praxis AI image watches its configuration file and reloads routes and
clusters once the kubelet refreshes the mounted ConfigMap, which took about a
minute in testing. Listener changes still need a restart. To apply an edit
right away, run `kubectl -n praxis rollout restart deployment/praxis-gateway`.

### Exposing the gateway

The chart creates a ClusterIP Service by default. Set `service.type` to
`LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, or put an Ingress, Gateway API route, or
OpenShift Route in front of the ClusterIP Service. To terminate TLS in Praxis
itself, enable `listenerTls` with a TLS Secret. The certificate
mounts at `/etc/praxis/listener-tls`, and your listener references it:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: default
    address: "0.0.0.0:8080"
    tls:
      certificates:
        - cert_path: /etc/praxis/listener-tls/tls.crt
          key_path: /etc/praxis/listener-tls/tls.key
    filter_chains: [main]
```

On OpenShift, `route` renders a Route to the Service; it needs TLS at the
gateway and `route.host`. `networkPolicy` limits which pods may reach the
listener where the CNI enforces NetworkPolicy.

## Image

The default image is the official Praxis AI release, `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/ai`
at the chart's `appVersion` (0.4.0). Praxis AI is a Praxis build with the AI
filters included, and it runs any Praxis configuration. Praxis AI 0.4.0 is
built on Praxis 0.7.0; these are separate release versions.

`image.digest` defaults to empty so an `image.tag` override stays effective.
For immutable deployments, set `image.digest` explicitly to
`sha256:0f619d4a0b533093f94a76921cfbba0ecdec51557dffee1615a29721ee1fc878`.

Other Praxis builds work as long as they accept `--config <path>`, which the
chart passes through `args`. The core Praxis image's entrypoint already names
its own config path, so replace the entrypoint with `command`:

```bash
helm upgrade --install praxis-gateway charts/praxis-gateway \
  --namespace praxis --create-namespace \
  --set image.repository=ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/praxis \
  --set image.tag=0.7.1 \
  --set 'command={praxis}'
```

The chart uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Its `version`
identifies the chart package, while `appVersion` identifies the default
Praxis AI image; these values may advance independently.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `replicaCount` | int | `1` | Gateway replicas. |
| `image.repository` | string | `ghcr.io/praxis-proxy/ai` | Image repository. |
| `image.tag` | string | `0.4.0` | Image tag (ignored when `image.digest` is set). |
| `image.digest` | string | `""` | Immutable digest (sha256:…). When set, tag is ignored. |
| `image.flavor` | string | `ai` | `ai` or `grid-gateway`, the grid build that `praxisConfig.render.role: provider`, `praxisConfig.render.gridServing`, and telemetry need. A repository ending in `/grid-gateway` sets it. |
| `image.pullPolicy` | string | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy. |
| `imagePullSecrets` | list | `[]` | Pull secrets for private registries. |
| `log.level` | string | `""` | Level for every module, rendered as RUST_LOG on the gateway and overlay-sync: off, error, warn, info, debug, or trace, in any case. Empty leaves RUST_LOG unset, so the binaries use their info default. An `env` entry named RUST_LOG takes precedence on the gateway. |
| `log.filter` | string | `""` | Full RUST_LOG directive, such as `info,praxis_filter=debug`. When set, it replaces `log.level`. |
| `nameOverride` | string | `""` | Override chart name. |
| `fullnameOverride` | string | `""` | Override the fully qualified app name. Set it to the GridNetwork `gatewayRefs[].name` when the operator targets this Service by name. |
| `commonLabels` | object | `{}` | Labels added to all resources. |
| `podLabels` | object | `{}` | Additional pod labels. Selector labels cannot be overridden. |
| `podAnnotations` | object | `{}` | Pod annotations. |
| `podSecurityContext` | object | `{}` | Extra pod securityContext (`runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, `fsGroup`, `supplementalGroups`). |
| `imageUser.enabled` | string or bool | `auto` | Set `imageUser.uid` and `imageUser.gid` as the Praxis container's `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` when `podSecurityContext` sets no `runAsUser`. A `podSecurityContext.runAsGroup` replaces `imageUser.gid`. `auto` applies them only to the official `praxis-proxy` `ai`, `praxis`, and `grid-gateway` images or mirrors that keep that path, not their `-fips` tags, which run as 1001:1001, and not on OpenShift (`security.openshift.io/v1`), where the SCC assigns IDs. Other images keep the user they declare. `true` forces them for any image, such as one built `FROM` the official images that keeps the named user `praxis`. |
| `imageUser.uid` | int | `100` | Numeric user of the official Praxis images, which declare the named user `praxis`. |
| `imageUser.gid` | int | `101` | Numeric group of the official Praxis images. |
| `command` | list | `[]` | Container command, replacing the image entrypoint. Empty keeps the entrypoint. |
| `args` | list | `["--config", "/etc/praxis/praxis.yaml"]` | Container arguments. |
| `praxisConfig.source` | string | `byo` | Source that writes `praxis.yaml`: `byo`, `operator`, or `render`. Set `render` explicitly for chart-generated Grid routing config. |
| `praxisConfig.byo.configMapName` | string | `""` | ConfigMap with the Praxis config. Empty serves `praxisConfig.byo.inline`. Editing it does not restart the pods. |
| `praxisConfig.byo.key` | string | `praxis.yaml` | Key in the BYO ConfigMap. |
| `praxisConfig.byo.inline` | string | answers `GET /` with a JSON status, else 404 | Praxis config stored in a chart-managed ConfigMap when `praxisConfig.byo.configMapName` is empty. Changing it rolls the pods. |
| `praxisConfig.operator.configMapName` | string | `""` | Operator-created ConfigMap. Empty uses `praxis-consumer-config`. |
| `praxisConfig.operator.allowUnauthenticatedExposure` | bool | `false` | Allow a LoadBalancer or NodePort Service for the operator's unauthenticated `praxis.yaml`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.telemetry.enabled` | bool | `false` | Enable OTLP/gRPC export and W3C header propagation in generated `praxis.yaml`. Requires `praxisConfig.source: render` and `image.flavor: grid-gateway`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.telemetry.otlpEndpoint` | string | `""` | OTLP endpoint without URL userinfo, query, or fragment credentials. Empty uses `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` from the container environment. |
| `praxisConfig.render.telemetry.samplingRate` | number | unset | Root sampling probability, from `0.0` through `1.0`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.telemetry.serviceName` / `serviceVersion` / `environment` | string | unset | OpenTelemetry resource attributes. |
| `praxisConfig.render.telemetry.batchIntervalSecs` / `batchSize` | int | unset | OTLP batch export interval from 1 through 300 seconds and maximum batch size from 1 through 65,536 spans. |
| `praxisConfig.render.model` | string | **required** for a consumer without `praxisConfig.render.gridServing` | Model advertised on the routing candidates. |
| `praxisConfig.render.backends` | map | **required** when rendered | Backends keyed by site, each with `endpoint` and optional `healthCheck` and `transport`. A consumer's key is the site it reaches over mutual TLS. A provider's `local` key is its one plaintext backend. The older list of `cluster`, `endpoints` entries still renders. |
| `praxisConfig.render.backends[].site` | string | `grid.siteName` | Grid site the backend serves. A consumer's remote `mutual_tls` backend must name it, and it must differ from `grid.siteName`. Its `transport.sni` defaults to `<site>.grid.internal`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.backends[].transport` | object | Remote site: `mutual_tls` with Grid identity; otherwise set `mode` explicitly. Provider local backend: `plaintext`. | `mode`: `mutual_tls` presents the grid identity and verifies with `gridIdentity.caSecretName`; `tls` verifies the server cert with no client cert; `plaintext` is cleartext. `sni` names the peer cert (required for `mutual_tls` and for `tls` to an IP endpoint). `ca` (`configMapName` or `secretName`, `key`) is the CA for a `tls` backend. A `tls` backend trusts, first match wins: `transport.ca`, then `upstreamCA`, then the process store, which is the `auth.validateCA` bundle when that is set. |
| `praxisConfig.render.backends[].connectTimeoutMs` | int | praxis default | Connect timeout, at most `totalConnectTimeoutMs` when you set both. |
| `praxisConfig.render.backends[].trustPrivate` | bool | `false` | Let the backend's hostname endpoints resolve to private addresses. Needs a praxis build with `trusted_private_endpoints`, which 0.7.x lacks. Over plaintext it also needs `allowPlaintextTrust`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.role` | string | `consumer` | `provider` serves grid peers on the grid identity and forwards to one local backend. |
| `praxisConfig.render.peerTrust.mode` | string | `pin` | Provider peer allowlist. The grid-site `gridNetwork.peerTrust.mode` is the source of truth, and this must match it. `pin` lists leaf certificate digests in `certDigests`. `spiffe` lists SPIFFE IDs in `spiffeIds` and needs X.509-SVID leaves. |
| `praxisConfig.render.peerTrust.digest` | string | `""` | Pin mode: lowercase hex SHA-256 of the allowed peer's DER leaf. `nextDigest` adds the next one during a rotation. |
| `praxisConfig.render.peerTrust.certDigests` | list | `[]` | Pin mode: more allowed digests. |
| `praxisConfig.render.peerTrust.spiffeId` | string | `""` | SPIFFE mode: an allowed SPIFFE ID. `spiffeIds` takes more. The render needs one unless `allowAnyGridSite`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.peerTrust.spiffeIds` | list | `[]` | SPIFFE mode: every allowed peer. The handshake and filter chain use the same site list. |
| `praxisConfig.render.peerTrust.allowAnyGridSite` | bool | `false` | SPIFFE mode with no IDs: accept any enrolled site. It cannot be set beside `spiffeIds`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.provider.allowedPaths` | list | chat, completions, models, embeddings | Exact paths a provider forwards, GET and POST only. Other paths get a 404, other methods a 405. |
| `grid.networkName` | string | `""` | GridNetwork name for overlay-sidecar scope validation. Required when the sidecar is on. |
| `grid.siteName` | string | `""` | This gateway's site name. Required for render and when the overlay sidecar is on. A consumer scores locality with it; a provider returns it in `X-Grid-Provider-Site`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.auth.mode` | string | **required** for a render consumer | `api-key` validates the caller's key and needs an image that registers `identity/api-key` (praxis-policy 0.4 or later); the render refuses it on the default `ai:0.4.0` image (by effective reference; a digest pin of that same image is not detected). `none` renders no policy filter, for use only behind an authenticating front. |
| `praxisConfig.render.auth.allowUnauthenticatedExposure` | bool | `false` | With `none`, allow a LoadBalancer or NodePort Service. Without it the render fails. The guard sees only this chart's Service, not `oc expose`, another Service selecting the pod labels, an HTTPRoute, or a hand-made Service with `service.enabled=false`. Use `networkPolicy` for those. |
| `praxisConfig.render.auth.stripAuthorization` | bool | `true` | Remove the caller's `Authorization` before routing, in either mode. Forwarded grid hops authenticate by mTLS identity. `false` forwards the caller's key or bearer to every backend and cross-site peer, so use it only when the backend validates that same credential. |
| `praxisConfig.render.auth.validateUrl` | string | **required** for `api-key` | https validate endpoint. |
| `praxisConfig.render.auth.allowPrivateEndpoint` | bool | `false` | Sets `allow_private_idp`, which is engine-wide: every policy callout in this gateway, not only `validateUrl`, may then reach private, loopback, link-local, and cloud metadata addresses. Turn it on only when every policy in the gateway is yours. |
| `praxisConfig.render.auth.validateCA` | object | empty | CA for the validate call (`configMapName` or `secretName`, `key`). Set as `SSL_CERT_FILE`, which replaces the platform trust store for the validate call and https backends without a per-backend CA or `upstreamCA`. mutual_tls backends and `upstreamCA` are unaffected. See the recipe below. |
| `networkPolicy.enabled` | bool | `false` | Render a NetworkPolicy that limits which pods can reach the listener port, where the CNI enforces NetworkPolicy. It is not authentication. Node and host-network traffic handling is CNI-specific (OVN-Kubernetes: the `policy-group.network.openshift.io/host-network` label), and a LoadBalancer with `externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster` can SNAT clients to node IPs. |
| `networkPolicy.from` | list | `[]` | NetworkPolicyPeer entries allowed in. Required when enabled. With `auth.mode: none`, list only the authenticating front. `{podSelector: {}}` admits every pod in this namespace. An empty `namespaceSelector` and an `ipBlock` of `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0` admit everyone and fail the render. An all-address `ipBlock` with `except` entries is allowed. The check reads selector emptiness and the cidr only, so `matchExpressions` that happen to select every pod pass. A provider gateway behind a LoadBalancer that SNATs clients to node IPs needs `ipBlock` peers for those node addresses. |
| `metricsListener.enabled` | bool | `false` | Serve `GET /metrics` over TLS on its own port and ClusterIP Service, for an in-cluster Prometheus. The admin listener refuses a non-loopback Host, so Prometheus cannot scrape it. Needs the grid-gateway image, `existingSecret`, `fromNamespaces`, and `networkPolicy.enabled`. The port answers only `/metrics` but has no authentication, so the NetworkPolicy is its access control, and that holds only where the CNI enforces NetworkPolicy. |
| `metricsListener.existingSecret` | string | `""` | Secret with `tls.crt` and `tls.key`. On OpenShift, request it with `metricsListener.service.annotations` `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name`. The listener reloads the cert when the Secret changes. |
| `metricsListener.fromNamespaces` | list | `[]` | Namespace names allowed to reach the metrics port, for example `openshift-user-workload-monitoring`. |
| `metricsListener.serviceMonitor.enabled` | bool | `false` | Render a ServiceMonitor that verifies the cert against `caConfigMap` (for example `openshift-service-ca.crt`, key `service-ca.crt`) and renames Praxis's `cluster` label to `backend`, since ACM uses `cluster` for the managed cluster. |
| `upstreamCA.secretName` | string | `""` | CA bundle for backend TLS without a per-cluster CA. Empty disables the mount. Works with `render` and `byo`; BYO `praxis.yaml` must set `runtime.upstream_ca_file`. The bundle replaces system trust roots; include public and private roots when both are needed. Per-cluster CAs override this bundle. Not supported with `operator`. |
| `listenerTls.secretName` | string | `""` | Server certificate Secret (`tls.crt`, `tls.key`) for listener TLS. Non-empty enables TLS and names the port `https`. Works with render consumers and `byo`; BYO `praxis.yaml` must reference `listenerTls.mountPath`. Render providers reject this setting and use `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` for listener TLS. Not supported with `operator`. On OpenShift, annotate the Service with `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name`. |
| `port.containerPort` | int | `8080` | Container port. |
| `port.name` | string | `""` | Port name. Empty: `https` when `listenerTls.secretName` is set, else `http`. |
| `port.protocol` | string | `TCP` | Port protocol. |
| `service.enabled` | bool | `true` | Create a Service. |
| `service.type` | string | `""` | Service type. Empty: `LoadBalancer` for a provider, else `ClusterIP`. |
| `service.port` | int | `8080` | Service port. |
| `service.annotations` | object | `{}` | Service annotations. |
| `service.loadBalancerIP` | string | `""` | Static IP for LoadBalancer. |
| `route.enabled` | bool | `false` | Render an OpenShift Route to the Service. Needs TLS at the gateway and `route.host`. |
| `route.tls.termination` | string | `passthrough` | `passthrough`, or `reencrypt` with `route.tls.destinationCACertificate`. A provider allows only `passthrough`. |
| `overlay.configMapName` | string | `""` | Overlay ConfigMap name. Non-empty enables delivery; BYO only. `operator` and `render` fail because their `praxis.yaml` does not read the overlay file. |
| `overlay.mountPath` | string | `/etc/praxis/routing` | Directory where BYO `praxis.yaml` reads `routing-overlay.json`. |
| `overlay.sidecar.enabled` | bool | `true` | Run overlay-sync. False mounts the ConfigMap directly (slower kubelet updates, no validation, ServiceAccount, or Role). |
| `overlay.sidecar.image.repository` | string | `grid-overlay-sync` | Overlay-sync image repository. Use a published or locally built image appropriate to the deployment. |
| `overlay.sidecar.image.tag` | string | `v0.1.4` | Overlay-sync image tag. Use an immutable published tag for reproducible deployments. |
| `overlay.sidecar.image.pullPolicy` | string | `IfNotPresent` | Overlay-sync image pull policy. |
| `overlay.sidecar.dataKey` | string | `routing-overlay.json` | Content-addressed envelope key in the overlay ConfigMap. |
| `overlay.sidecar.resources` | object | small requests and limits | Resources for both the one-shot init container and continuous sidecar. |
| `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.enabled` | bool | `false` | Mount the operator's serving config, set `GRID_SERVING_CONFIG`, and route with `grid_site_route`. Consumer role and `image.flavor: grid-gateway` only. Needs `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` and `gridIdentity.caSecretName`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.networkName` | string | `""` | GridNetwork name, which with `gatewayRefName` names the operator's ConfigMap. |
| `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.gatewayRefName` | string | release fullname | This gateway's name in the GridNetwork `gatewayRefs`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.configMapName` | string | `""` | Overrides `grid-serving-<networkName>-<gatewayRefName>`. Needed when that name passes 63 characters. |
| `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.mountPath` | string | `/etc/praxis/grid-serving` | Mount directory for the ConfigMap. |
| `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.siteRoute.availability` | object | `{}` | Site availability, rendered into the `grid_site_route` filter block with keys snake_case as the filter reads them (`shedding`, `smoothing`, `ceiling_half_life_ms`, `ceiling_floor`, `explore_floor`, `full_after_ms`, `room_after_ms`, `queue_full`). Every field defaults and `shedding` is the one switch. See `examples/gateway/grid-site-route.yaml`. |
| `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.siteRoute.prefixAffinity` | object | `{}` | Prefix affinity tuning rendered as the filter's `prefix_affinity` (`enabled`, `threshold`, `exploration`, `prefill_tokens_per_second`, `queued_request_seconds`, `tag_key_path`). |
| `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` | string | `""` | Secret with `tls.crt` and `tls.key`. Non-empty mounts the identity and makes implicit render transports use mTLS. Requires `gridIdentity.caSecretName`. |
| `gridIdentity.caSecretName` | string | `""` | Secret with public `ca.crt`. Required when `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` is set. The Grid operator writes the CA as `grid-ca`. |
| `gridIdentity.mountPath` | string | `/etc/praxis/tls` | Directory where the identity and CA keys are projected. For operator mTLS, match `consumerConfig.tlsCertMountPath`. |
| `providerCredentials` | list | `[]` | Provider credential Secrets (`secretName`, optional `mountPath`, `optional`). `mountPath` defaults to `/run/secrets/grid-credentials/<secretName>`, matching the operator. |
| `health.readiness` | object | admin `/ready`, else TCP on the listener port | Readiness probe. A `tcpSocket` without a port runs an HTTP check against the admin listener when the chart sees a loopback admin listener in its rendered config or `praxisConfig.byo.inline`, and otherwise targets the listener port. It asks `/healthy` when the gateway forwards to backends (rendered backends, `gridServing`, or inline clusters), since `/ready` fails while any backend is down, and `/ready` otherwise. The check runs `/bin/sh` with `curl` or `wget`, whichever the image has; set `health.adminProbeCommand` for an image with neither. The chart refuses that fallback when a BYO inline listener serves TLS, since a TCP connect fails a TLS handshake on every probe. With a BYO ConfigMap the chart cannot see the listener, so give the probes an `httpGet` or `exec` handler when it serves TLS. Give `tcpSocket` a port or another handler to keep your own probe. Set to null to disable. |
| `health.liveness` | object | admin `/healthy`, else TCP on the listener port | Liveness probe, chosen the same way against `/healthy`. Set to null to disable. |
| `health.adminProbeCommand` | list | `[]` | Command for the admin-listener probe; the URL is appended. Empty runs `/bin/sh` with `curl` or `wget`. |
| `shutdownDelaySeconds` | int | `5` | Seconds a terminating pod keeps serving before Praxis gets SIGTERM, so Service endpoints drop it first and rollouts do not refuse requests. Runs the image's `sleep` as a preStop hook. `0` disables it, which an image without `sleep` (distroless or scratch) needs. |
| `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | int | `null` | Seconds Kubernetes gives a terminating pod before killing it. Empty means 30 plus `shutdownDelaySeconds`, so Praxis keeps its default 30 second drain after the delay. Raise it for a longer Praxis `shutdown_timeout_secs`. Must exceed `shutdownDelaySeconds`. |

## Metrics

The metrics listener serves the Praxis registry, including the grid gateway's own series. With the ServiceMonitor, Praxis's `cluster` label arrives as `backend`.

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `grid_route_decisions_total` | `site`, `reason` | Requests `grid_site_route` decided. `site` is a site name from the serving config, or empty for a refusal. No label comes from the request. |
| `grid_route_site_score` | `site`, `cluster` | The queue depth the last route order used for each candidate, lower first. `inf` when unmeasured, `NaN` when excluded or demoted, or when the pair left the topology. |

`reason` is one of five values, and adding one is a deliberate change:

| `reason` | `site` | Response |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `routed` | chosen site | Sent to a healthy site. How it ranked is in `grid_route_site_score`. |
| `fallback` | chosen site | Sent to a demoted site because no healthy one was left. |
| `not_ready` | empty | 503: every candidate was excluded. |
| `no_route` | empty | 503: an admitted candidate had no route from this gateway. |
| `bad_request` | empty | 400 or 404: no model, or a model no candidate serves. |

## Security

The chart enforces Kubernetes restricted security defaults:

- `runAsNonRoot: true`, running the official images as their numeric user
  (`imageUser`, 100:101) unless `podSecurityContext` sets `runAsUser` or the
  cluster is OpenShift, where the SCC assigns IDs. Other images keep the user
  they declare.
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- All Linux capabilities dropped
- `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault`
- `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

When overlay-sync is enabled, the pod uses a dedicated ServiceAccount, but
automatic token mounting remains disabled. A short-lived projected token is
mounted only into the overlay-sync init and sidecar containers. The Praxis
container has no Kubernetes API credential and mounts the delivered overlay
directory read-only.

## Optional uses

These sections describe settings that matter only for particular setups.

### Edge gateway

An edge gateway is the entry point for clients outside the cluster. A typical
starting point runs more than one replica behind a LoadBalancer and
terminates TLS in Praxis:

```yaml
replicaCount: 2
topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: praxis-gateway
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
listenerTls:
  secretName: edge-gateway-tls
```

Pair it with a configuration whose listener references the certificate, as
shown in [Exposing the gateway](#exposing-the-gateway).

### AI Grid Network (AGN)

AGN deploys this chart as its consumer (edge) and provider gateways. These
settings exist for that integration:

- `praxisConfig.source: render` builds the AGN routing configuration
  (`intelligent_route` and `load_balancer`, with optional `api-key` caller
  authentication) from values, with `praxisConfig.render.backends` keyed by site.
- `praxisConfig.render.role: provider` serves grid peers on the site identity, admits
  them by `peerTrust`, and forwards to one local backend. It needs
  `image.flavor: grid-gateway`.
- `praxisConfig.render.gridServing` routes each model to the least-loaded site from the operator's
  serving config (see [Cross-site routing in AGN](#cross-site-routing-in-agn)).
- `overlay.configMapName` mounts the routing overlay the AGN Operator publishes
  for BYO `praxis.yaml`; the overlay-sync sidecar validates and delivers it.
- `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` mounts the site identity used for mTLS between sites.

The standard Praxis AI 0.4.0 image supports AGN provider selection and load
balancing and includes Basic Auth. It does not include the optional
`token-rate-limit-filter` required by the distributed token quota
qualification. That qualification is not supported by this default image; AGN
does not publish a replacement AI rollup.

### Edge and provider gateways in AGN

AGN runs this chart in two roles with different values:

**Edge gateway:**
- Listens on port 8080 (HTTP)
- Mounts an overlay ConfigMap from the AGN Operator
- Mounts a TLS Secret for upstream connections

**Provider gateway:**
- Listens on port 8443 (mTLS)
- Mounts a TLS Secret for client authentication
- Mounts credential Secrets for backend provider access
- Helm release name must match the mock-providers
  `networkPolicy.providerGateway.instanceLabel` (default: `provider-gateway`)
  so the NetworkPolicy allows traffic

### Resource names for the AGN Operator

The chart's fullname template produces `{release}-praxis-gateway` by
default (e.g., release `provider-gateway` → Service name
`provider-gateway-praxis-gateway`). Set `fullnameOverride` to control
the exact Service name:

```yaml
fullnameOverride: provider-gateway   # Service name = provider-gateway
```

The AGN Operator's `gateway.serviceName` must match the provider
gateway's Service name. When using `fullnameOverride`, set
`gateway.serviceName` to the same value in the operator Helm values.

### Cross-site routing in AGN

With `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.enabled`, the consumer gateway reads the serving config the
grid operator writes (under `signalTransport: poll`) and polls each peer's
`/v1/site/signals` over mTLS with the grid identity at `gridIdentity.mountPath`. It routes
each model to the least-loaded admitted site. The chosen candidate's cluster must
name a `praxisConfig.render.backends` cluster, so give each backend the operator's
candidate cluster (the provider's `routingClusterRef`, else its name).

A `grid-gateway` built from the current source re-reads `serving-config.json`
every five seconds after the kubelet updates the mounted ConfigMap. It applies
candidate, peer, address, and pin changes without a pod restart. Invalid updates
keep the last accepted serving settings and topology. Changes to mounted
identity files can still restart signals pollers using those accepted settings.
Check gateway logs and
`grid_serving_config_reload_total{result="applied"}` for acceptance; the
`grid.praxis.fast/serving-digest` annotation records publication, not acceptance.

The same watcher detects changes to the mounted CA, client certificate, and
key, and rebuilds the signals pollers. This refreshes their mTLS identity; it
does not renew certificates or change provider-listener TLS settings. Older
images without this watcher still need a rollout. Choose an image that includes
the watcher before relying on live updates.

Known limits:

- `grid_site_route` does not check provider health, so it can pick a site whose
  provider gateway is down. That request fails rather than failing over.
- The gateway matches a candidate's cluster to `praxisConfig.render.backends` by name only.
  Nothing checks that the backend serves the candidate's site.
- The serving watcher does not add load-balancer clusters to `praxis.yaml`.
  Add each new candidate's backend there too. Listener changes and serving
  `window_secs` changes require a restart.
- Site certificates last 180 days. Under `spiffe` trust the operator rotates them
  around day 120. The serving watcher refreshes the signals pollers' mounted
  identity automatically, but provider-listener certificate reload depends on the
  Praxis build. Under `pin` trust nothing rotates them: re-enroll each site and
  update the peers' digests before it expires.

### Routing overlay delivery

Praxis can hot-reload a routing overlay as soon as its file changes. A normal
ConfigMap volume, however, is updated by the kubelet on an eventual refresh
cycle. That delay can be longer than a temporary provider-pressure event, so a
gateway may continue serving an old preference even though AGN has already
published a new overlay.

Overlays are supported with `praxisConfig.source: byo`; your `praxis.yaml` must
set `overlay_file` to
`/etc/praxis/routing/routing-overlay.json`. `overlay.configMapName` turns
delivery on. With the sidecar on (the default), set `grid.networkName` and
`grid.siteName`; the chart fullname must match the GridNetwork's
`gatewayRefs[].name`, so set `fullnameOverride` when needed. Otherwise the
sidecar refuses the overlay and the pod does not start. `operator` and `render`
sources do not read the overlay file and reject `overlay.configMapName`.

The sidecar gives faster validated delivery. To use the kubelet-mounted
ConfigMap instead, set `overlay.sidecar.enabled: false`; updates are slower and
are not validated, and no ServiceAccount or Role is created.

```text
AGN Operator updates ConfigMap
             |
             | Kubernetes API watch
             v
      overlay-sync sidecar
        validate envelope
        atomic file replace
        retain last-known-good on failure
             |
             | shared emptyDir
             v
       Praxis hot reload
```

Example values:

```yaml
overlay:
  configMapName: grid-overlay-production-consumer-gateway
  mountPath: /etc/praxis/routing
  sidecar:
    enabled: true
    image:
      repository: registry.example.com/grid-overlay-sync
      tag: <version>
      pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    dataKey: routing-overlay.json
grid:
  networkName: production
  siteName: us-east-edge
```

When enabled, the chart creates:

- an `overlay-sync-init` init container that waits for the first valid overlay
  before Praxis starts;
- an `overlay-sync` sidecar that watches one named ConfigMap;
- a shared `emptyDir` used for atomic file publication;
- a dedicated ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding; and
- sidecar readiness and liveness probes on port `9091`.

The sidecar validates maximum size, schema version, destination scope,
content-addressed revision, and SHA-256 digest. Invalid replacements do not
touch the serving file. ConfigMap deletion or temporary API loss marks the
sidecar degraded while retaining the last-known-good overlay.

This mechanism removes kubelet projection latency only after AGN applies a
ConfigMap. Total route-change time still includes metrics publication, the
provider scrape, AGN reconciliation, ConfigMap application, sidecar delivery,
and Praxis hot reload. Overlay-sync does not change the scrape or reconcile
intervals.

With `overlay.sidecar.enabled: false`, the chart retains the simpler direct
ConfigMap mount. Use that compatibility mode for static configuration or when
kubelet-controlled refresh latency is acceptable.

### KServe backend on OpenShift

A KServe LLMInferenceService serves HTTPS on :8000 with a cert from the OpenShift
service CA. Use the workload Service ClusterIP as the endpoint: praxis refuses a
hostname that resolves to a private address. Set `sni` to the Service DNS name, which
the cert carries, and trust the service CA that OpenShift injects into every namespace:

```yaml
praxisConfig:
  source: render
  render:
    backends:
      - cluster: local-qwen3
        endpoints: ["172.30.12.34:8000"]   # kubectl get svc qwen3-kserve-workload-svc -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
        transport:
          mode: tls
          sni: qwen3-kserve-workload-svc.llm.svc
          ca: { configMapName: openshift-service-ca.crt, key: service-ca.crt }
```

The health check defaults to `tcp` for TLS backends.

#### validateCA bundle recipe

The bundle replaces the platform store, so include the image's roots with the
private CA:

```sh
podman run --rm --entrypoint cat <gateway image> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt > bundle.pem
cat service-ca.crt >> bundle.pem
kubectl create configmap gateway-validate-ca --from-file=ca.crt=bundle.pem
```

Then set `praxisConfig.render.auth.validateCA.configMapName=gateway-validate-ca`. If only
the validate call and mutual_tls backends make TLS calls, the service CA alone
is enough. Public https backends can instead take `upstreamCA`.

## Upgrading

The `praxis-gateway` chart changes from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5 reject previous gateway
value names rather than ignoring them. Migrate the values before `helm upgrade`.
These are gateway chart values; the separate CRD field rename is not part of
this branch.

Use this mapping:

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `config.existingConfigMap` | `praxisConfig.byo.configMapName` |
| `config.key` | `praxisConfig.byo.key` |
| `config.inline` | `praxisConfig.byo.inline` |
| `gatewayConfig.render: true` | `praxisConfig.source: render` |
| `gatewayConfig.<field>` | `praxisConfig.render.<field>` |
| `gatewayConfig.localSite` | `grid.siteName` |
| `gatewayConfig.listenerTls` / `listenerTls.enabled` + `existingSecret` | `listenerTls.secretName` |
| `gatewayConfig.upstreamCA` / `praxisConfig.render.upstreamCA` | top-level `upstreamCA` |
| `tls.enabled` + `tls.existingSecret` | `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` |
| `tls.caSecret` | `gridIdentity.caSecretName` |
| `tls.mountPath` | `gridIdentity.mountPath` |
| `credentials[].name` | `providerCredentials[].secretName` |
| `praxisConfig.render.auth.validateCA.configMap` / `.secret` | `.configMapName` / `.secretName` |
| `praxisConfig.render.backends[].transport.ca.configMap` / `.secret` | `.configMapName` / `.secretName` |
| `overlay.enabled` + `overlay.existingConfigMap` | `overlay.configMapName` |
| `overlay.sidecar.expectedNetwork` / `expectedLocalSite` | `grid.networkName` / `grid.siteName` |
| `gridServing.enabled` | `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.enabled` |
| `gridServing.network` | `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.networkName` |
| `gridServing.gatewayRef` | `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.gatewayRefName` |
| `gridServing.configMap` | `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.configMapName` |
| `gridServing.mountPath` | `praxisConfig.render.gridServing.mountPath` |

`gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` names the identity Secret (`tls.crt`, `tls.key`);
`gridIdentity.caSecretName` names the public CA Secret (`ca.crt`) and is required
with it. The chart projects only those keys, not the CA Secret's private key.

Behavior changes:

- Set `praxisConfig.source: render` explicitly; Grid settings no longer enable it
  automatically. Render requires `grid.siteName` and no longer defaults it to `hub`.
- `listenerTls.secretName` and `upstreamCA.secretName` fail with `source: operator`;
  the operator's `praxis.yaml` uses neither.
- `upstreamCA` now mounts with `source: byo`; set `runtime.upstream_ca_file` in
  your BYO `praxis.yaml` to use it.
- An overlay is BYO-only. `overlay.sidecar.enabled` now defaults to `true`,
  previously `false`. The sidecar requires `grid.networkName` and `grid.siteName`
  and creates a ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding. Set `fullnameOverride` to
  the GridNetwork `gatewayRefs[].name`. Set `overlay.sidecar.enabled: false` for a direct,
  unvalidated ConfigMap mount.
- Grid gateways no longer take the Helm release name automatically. Set
  `fullnameOverride` to the GridNetwork `gatewayRefs[].name` when the operator
  targets the gateway Service by name.
- The Grid identity is no longer mounted automatically. A provider, or a consumer with
  site backends, used to get `grid-site-identity` and `grid-ca` without any TLS values.
  Set `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` and `gridIdentity.caSecretName` explicitly.
- `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` now requires `gridIdentity.caSecretName`; the old `grid-ca`
  default and the fallback to the identity Secret are gone, and the render fails without
  it. Pods would otherwise hang when the identity Secret has no `ca.crt`. If one Secret
  holds all three files, set both names to it.
- A site backend with no `transport.mode` and no `gridIdentity.tlsSecretName` fails the
  render. It used to get mTLS automatically. Set the identity, or set
  `transport.mode: plaintext` to send it in the clear on purpose.
- `overlay.items` is removed. The chart mounts only `routing-overlay.json`;
  update any BYO `overlay_file` path that names `routing-config.json`.
- `praxisConfig.render.role: provider` and `praxisConfig.render.gridServing` require
  `image.flavor: grid-gateway`.

## Where this chart lives

The chart is developed in the
[praxis-proxy/grid](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/grid) repository and may
move to a dedicated Praxis repository later.
